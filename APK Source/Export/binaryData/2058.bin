  <string name="tutorial_step_1">Hi and welcome to WordOn.^I'll teach you how to play the game. Let's start, shall we?</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_2">Below you see the game board where you place words and the seven letters on your rack.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_3">The spots with a 'W' are special. The letter you put on there will go to your opponent.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_4">Now, create the word '{0}'. You can do this by dragging or tapping the letters.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_5">Well done!^Press 'PLAY' to confirm your word.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_6">Great! As you can see, I received your '{0}' and '{1}' letters. These are called 'WordOns'.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_7">Now it's my turn to play a word. Let's see...</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_8">I could not use your 'WordOns'. Their value is subtracted from my word score, making '{0}' worth {1} points.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_9">It's your turn again.^Use the 'WordOn' letter '{0}' and form the word '{1}'.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_10">This word is worth {0} points. Hmm, it seems we can do better than that. Please press 'CLEAR'.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_11">Great! Now use both 'WordOns' to place the word '{0}'.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_12">That's better! The word value for '{0}' doubled because you used all 'WordOns'.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_13">Better words earn a higher score and more Coins! Try placing '{0}'.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_14">Super! This gives {0} points and {1} Coins, awesome! Let's play this word, shall we?</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_15">Coins earned are stored in your piggy bank at the top of the screen. Tapping the piggy will take you to the shop.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_15b">Besides unlocking cool new stuff, you can trade Coins for Stars in the shop!</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_16">Stars are great! You can use them for all kinds of things like peeking and getting hints!</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_17">Press 'PEEK' and get a look at your opponents' letters.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_18">Well done! Use this to strategically give away letters you know will cause problems for your opponent.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_18b">Oh and here's another tip: the number below PEEK shows how many letters are left before the game ends.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_19">Now tap the 'HINT' button to see a letter appear for the best possible word.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_20">You got it! Use multiple hints if you're stuck, but the number below HINT is the limit for your current game.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_21">Use the 'PEEK' and 'HINT' options to gain a possible advantage over your opponent.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_step_22">You're ready to start a real game! Remember, you can always replay this tutorial from the settings menu.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_analyzer_step_1">Hey there! Have you noticed the gray bar with a question mark? It's called the Wordalyzer, a useful tool when activated!</string>
  <string name="tutorial_analyzer_step_2">The question mark will make room for a number showing the point value of your current word.</string>
  <string name="tutorial_analyzer_step_3">The color will change depending on whether you're using the WordOns. Hint: gold is better!</string>
  <string name="tutorial_analyzer_step_4">The coins indicate whether you can score more points with your current letters. Can you find the 5-coin-word?</string>
